## About me

My name is Ravindra Tennekone, or Ravi for short. I am an aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for learning. My background is in the banking industry where I worked for two global financial institutions. In my work I was exposed to all aspects of corporate and retail banking. I live in Washington state.  
  
One of my favourite things to do is to analyze financial and economic data and try to find patterns and trends to see what that data is telling me. This site is a blog of my journey into this new field and will be a place where I post my portfolio projects.  

I hope you find something useful for you here and do feel free to reach out to me on my links at the bottom of the page.  

With Kind Regards,  
Ravi
