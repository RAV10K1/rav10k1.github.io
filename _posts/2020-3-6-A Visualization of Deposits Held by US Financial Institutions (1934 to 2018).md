In this post we will take a look at the growth of the deposit base held by US financial institutions from 1934 to 2018. This project is based on publicly available data obtained from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [(FDIC)] database.

The size of the United States economy is simply staggering. As of the latest estimate for the last quarter of 2019, US GDP was measured at an astounding US $ 21.73 trillion.[(www.bea.gov)]((www.bea.gov))

The United States is home to two of out of ten of the largest financial institutions in the world as of 2019 according to this [investopedia article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122315/worlds-top-10-banks-jpm-wfc.asp).
