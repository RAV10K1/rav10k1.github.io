In this post we will take a look at the growth of the deposit base held by US financial institutions from 1934 to 2018. This project is based on publicly available data obtained from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [FDIC]((https://banks.data.fdic.gov/explore/historical/)) database.

The size of the United States economy is simply staggering. As of the latest estimate for the last quarter of 2019, US GDP was measured at an astounding US $ 21.73 trillion.[(www.bea.gov)]((www.bea.gov))

The United States is home to two of out of ten of the largest financial institutions in the world as of 2019 according to this [investopedia article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122315/worlds-top-10-banks-jpm-wfc.asp). However historically the US has hosted thousands of banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions.

The above image depicts the number of financial institutions (FI's) doing business in the United States throughout this period. The trend appears to be relatively steady until 1984 where we see a rapid overall decline of the total number of FI's operating in the country to just 4,717 as of 2018 from a high of 14,496 institutions in 1984.
